The Virtual Train Route Planner is a simulation system that allows users to navigate train stations in real-time.
It models a railway route using linked list data structures:

Doubly Linked List → for forward and backward navigation along a straight train route.

Circular Linked List → for loop/metro routes where the last station connects back to the first.

Users can:

Add stations to a route.

Display the complete route.

Move forward or backward through stations.

Handle both normal routes (with an end station) and circular routes (infinite loops).
